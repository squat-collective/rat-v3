## 2026-05-30 — Phase −1 complete

The full architectural-design + adversarial-review phase, landed in one day with Claude.

### Roadmap structure + ADR-003 + post-synthesis doc updates
- Created `roadmap/` directory with CLAUDE.md (maintenance rules), README, phases.md, current.md, done.md, backlog.md
- Wrote **ADR-003** — "Two independent reference implementations before any contract freezes" (the C9 forcing function from synthesis)
- Updated **ADR-001 Migration section** — Phase 0 timeline shifted to 4-6 months; Critical cross-cutting concerns baked in; all 5 phases expanded with post-synthesis scope
- Updated **vision.md** — added "Anti-goals" section: (1) no new plugin axis in year 1 until 100 daily users on core, (2) effort ratio must invert from 95/5 architecture-to-GTM toward 60/40
- Updated **ADRs index** with ADR-003
- Updated **root CLAUDE.md** with roadmap reference + maintenance rule

### 5-perspective adversarial team review
- Spawned `rat-v3-review` team with 5 teammates (adversarial-architect, plugin-ecosystem-builder, operations-sre, security-reviewer, product-gtm) running in parallel via the experimental agent-teams feature
- Each produced a deep critique against the founding ADRs
- Wrote **synthesis** (`reviews/00-synthesis.md`) — 5 cross-cutting themes converged across all 5 reviewers, 10 Critical findings, 17 Important findings, 26 prospective ADRs, 2 roadmap shifts
- Headline finding: *the architecture is sound; the cross-cutting concerns that genuinely have to span plugins (trust, conformance, observability, distribution) have no owner; the proposed mitigations for the documented failure modes don't escape them*
- 5 review files: `01-adversarial-architect.md`, `02-plugin-ecosystem-builder.md`, `03-operations-sre.md`, `04-security-reviewer.md`, `05-product-gtm.md`
- Team gracefully shut down post-synthesis

### Founding ADRs landed
- **ADR-001** — "Everything is a plugin" (the founding principle: 6-thing core + 16+ plugin axes)
- **ADR-002** — "Founding tech stack + strategy decisions" (Go + NATS + JSON Schema + Apache 2.0 + K8s patterns + 7 other decisions across 10 questions; meta-principle: AI-rewrite escape hatch lowers tech-choice stakes)
- Both ADRs include rejected-alternatives tables, structured Consequences sections, and links to the conversations that produced them
- Conversation distillations committed: `docs/conversations/2026-05-30-the-vision-conversation.md` + `docs/conversations/2026-05-30-tech-stack-decisions.md`

### Initial scaffold
- Created `~/sandbox/rat/` project directory + git init
- Project CLAUDE.md with working principles (contracts before code, six-thing-core discipline, ADR-first, honest tradeoffs, capture-ideas-where-they're-born, save load-bearing conversations)
- README + .gitignore
- Vision document (the thesis) — minimal core + everything pluggable
- Architecture overview document — the integrated picture
- ADRs README with template + numbering/discipline rules
- Sub-CLAUDE.md files for `docs/architecture/adrs/`, `ideas/`, `docs/conversations/`
- ideas/inbox.md with 6 seed entries (later expanded to 11)
- research/prior-art/README.md (K8s, OSGi, VSCode, NATS, Temporal, etc.)
- research/competitors.md (Snowflake, Databricks, dbt, Airflow, Iceberg, MotherDuck — the landscape)
- 14 files, ~1276 lines, 1 commit (`7d57eab`)

### Git commits this session

```

(This entry's own commit lands separately — see git log for `docs(roadmap+adr): ...`.)

### What's true at end of day 2026-05-30

- Project lives at `~/sandbox/rat/`, git-initialized, ~3000 lines of architecture + thinking
- 3 Accepted ADRs (001, 002, 003)
- 2 conversation distillations
- 5 adversarial reviews + 1 synthesis
- 11 ideas captured in `ideas/inbox.md`
- Research scaffold present (prior art + competitors)
- Roadmap structure operational; this file is the proof
- **No code yet.** Awaiting Tom's commitment decision before Phase 0 starts.
