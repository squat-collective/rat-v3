# Current — what's in flight right now

> **Always read this first when opening a Claude session on this project.**
> Updated: 2026-06-01 (🎉 **Phase 0 contract surface COMPLETE** — all 18 axes frozen `v1` (`rat/1`→`rat/1.4`), 32 references conform (`make conformance` 32/32), cross-axis composition green, a 5-agent board review done ([reviews/08](../reviews/08-post-freeze-board-review.md)), and its one V2-regret fixed + `rat/1` re-cut (`0e81314`). **Now: COMPLETE & SEAL Phase 0** — close the four remaining gaps → cut a complete contract **`v1.1`** → then start **Phase 1 (the core)**. **Close-out items (1) catalog commit-linkage + (2) manifest schema freeze are DONE ([ADR-010](../docs/architecture/adrs/010-catalog-commit-linkage.md), [ADR-011](../docs/architecture/adrs/011-manifest-schema-freeze-and-per-kind-layer.md)); 2 remain — the doc tail + the `v1.1` cut.**)

## Status one-liner

**Phase 0 (lock the contracts) — contract surface is DONE; closing it out.** Every axis contract + the cross-cutting types are frozen at `v1`, backed by 32 conformance-passing references + a real cross-axis composition. The post-freeze board review confirmed the freeze was sound (one V2-regret, now fixed) and produced a precise punch-list. **The chosen next thread (2026-06-01): finish and seal Phase 0** — land the four close-out items below, cut contract `v1.1`, and hand Phase 1 a *complete* target. The board's enforcement + crash-safety findings (C1–C5, D1–D5) are deferred to **Phase 1 as its acceptance criteria** (they only become real once the core exists).

> Commitment-gate note: `phases.md` flags a 12–18mo runway + GTM commitment as a pre-Phase-0 gate. Tom chose to proceed in exploratory/sandbox mode. Gate acknowledged, not formally cleared — revisit before investing the full Phase 1 core build.

## Active stream — Phase 0 close-out (→ cut contract `v1.1`)

**Status:** in-flight (entered 2026-06-01). Ordered by value; (1) and (2) are substantive, (3) is docs, (4) is the tag.

1. ✅ **Catalog commit-linkage** — **DONE 2026-06-01 ([ADR-010](../docs/architecture/adrs/010-catalog-commit-linkage.md))**. The board's #1 functional gap ([reviews/08](../reviews/08-post-freeze-board-review.md) B1; 3 agents' top concern) is closed: additive `RegisterTable` + `CommitTable` RPCs on `catalog/v1` let a strategy create its own output table and record the snapshot `format.Write` produced (commit-linkage, with `MergeBranch`'s CAS + idempotency safety). `catalog.proto` +2 RPCs/+4 msgs (additive, `buf breaking` clean); all 4 SDKs regen'd; 3 catalog refs + 6 golden lifecycle steps; the composition now closes the create→write→register→merge loop on-wire (no out-of-band seeding). `make conformance` **32/32** + `make composition` ✅. Resolves ADR-009 residual R3. *(Staged; commit pending.)*
2. ✅ **Manifest schema freeze + per-kind schemas** — **DONE 2026-06-01 ([ADR-011](../docs/architecture/adrs/011-manifest-schema-freeze-and-per-kind-layer.md))**. `plugin.v1.json` frozen at `v1` (the last `v1-preview` artifact, gone); rolled `(rat.capability)` across the 12 unannotated axes (additive, SDKs regen'd) so all 18 capability sets are machine-readable; authored 18 per-kind schemas (`schema/kinds/`) with minimal-mandatory-core `provides` rules — the wrong/missing-required-capability mistake now fails fast. New `scripts/validate-manifests.py` + `make validate-manifests` gate (32/32) is the static half of `rat plugin validate`. `make conformance` **32/32**. *(Staged; commit pending.)*
3. ⬜ **Doc tail** — `overview.md` drift (rename the phantom `plane-manager-plugin` → `deployment-runtime`; add a tier-0 callout; reconcile "core never commands"; reviews/08 E4); the **12 missing control/experience `CONTRACT.md`** (reviews/08 E1); label round-1 refs `WIRE-CONTRACT ONLY — NOT A STARTER TEMPLATE` (E3); start the temptation ledger (E7).
4. ⬜ **Cut contract `v1.1`** — tag the completed, sealed surface; record in `done.md`. *(Optional while re-cutting: fold in the cheap additive crash-safety fields — `idempotency_key`, `ArrowStream` terminator — see backlog; they're additive so they can also wait for Phase 1.)*

**Immediate next concrete step:** item (3) — **the doc tail** ([reviews/08](../reviews/08-post-freeze-board-review.md) E1/E3/E4/E7): fix `overview.md` drift (rename the phantom `plane-manager-plugin` → `deployment-runtime`; add a tier-0 callout; reconcile "core never commands"); write the **12 missing control/experience `CONTRACT.md`**; label the round-1 references `WIRE-CONTRACT ONLY — NOT A STARTER TEMPLATE` (E3); start the temptation ledger in `done.md` (E7). Then item (4) — **cut contract `v1.1`** (tag the sealed surface). *(Items (1) + (2) are done — see above.)*

## After this stream — Phase 1 (the core), reframed

Phase 1 builds the 5–10k-LOC core (registry + reconciler + event bus + identity/state/API gateways). The board review gave it **testable exit criteria**: the core isn't "done" until the enforcement + crash-safety findings *pass* —

- **C5** capability enforcement (manifest `requires`/`provides` checked per call) · **C4** audit-on-every-decision incl. denials + stream-terminal · **C3** provider-call deadline propagation · **D1** isolation-profile conformance (a real enforcing deployment-runtime, not dry-run) · **D2/D3** ArrowStream-ticket + storage-cred isolation vectors · **D4** conformance-attestation verification (`declared == conformed`).

i.e. the board converted "the core will enforce X" into a definition of done. Full list: [reviews/08](../reviews/08-post-freeze-board-review.md) + [backlog.md](backlog.md).

## What's NOT in flight

- **Phase 1–5** — not started (Phase 1 begins after the close-out + `v1.1` cut).
- The board's `v1.1` *additive* contract fixes beyond catalog commit-linkage (idempotency key, ArrowStream terminator, terminal audit record, `WriteResult` merge breakdown, `TableRef` snapshot/as-of) — queued in [backlog.md](backlog.md); land opportunistically with the `v1.1` cut or as Phase 1 drives them out.
- The board's *enforcement-layer* findings — deferred to Phase 1 as acceptance criteria (above).

## Maintenance reminder

When this stream produces concrete output: update `done.md` → `current.md` → `phases.md` (if a phase moved) → `backlog.md` (if new work surfaced). Full rules in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
