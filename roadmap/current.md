# Current — what's in flight right now

> **Always read this first when opening a Claude session on this project.**

## Status one-liner

**Phase 0 in-flight (entered 2026-05-30).** Sub-phase 0a (manifest schema) drafted + container-validated. First contract artifact landed in `contracts/`. Next: per-kind schemas + the first axis protos (0b).

> Commitment-gate note: `phases.md` flags a 12–18mo runway + GTM commitment as a pre-Phase-0 gate. Tom chose to proceed in exploratory/sandbox mode. Gate acknowledged, not formally cleared — revisit before investing the full 4–6mo of Phase 0.

## Active streams

### Stream 1 — Phase 0: lock the contracts

**Status:** in-flight. Sub-phase 0a drafted.

Entered Phase 0 on 2026-05-30 (exploratory mode — see commitment-gate note above). First artifact: the manifest envelope schema.

**Done so far:**
- `contracts/` workspace created (`schema/`, `proto/`, `examples/`).
- `contracts/schema/plugin.v1.json` — manifest envelope schema (JSON Schema 2020-12), Critical fields C4/C5/C8 baked in.
- Two valid example manifests + a negative-vector doc; container-validated (all green).
- Per-kind-schema decision recorded in `contracts/schema/README.md` (envelope-first; per-kind layered in 0b).

**Next concrete step:** sub-phase **0b** — draft the first axis protos in `contracts/proto/`. Start with the axes the examples already reference (`strategy/v1`, `format-capability/v1`, `runtime/v1`) so the schema's capability URIs gain real service definitions. Each axis proto then drives its per-kind manifest schema.

### Stream 2 — Roadmap + ADR upkeep

**Status:** done as of this commit.

The synthesis raised 26 prospective ADRs; we DIDN'T write all of them. Instead we landed:
- ADR-003 (two-reference rule — the most-cited synthesis recommendation)
- Updated ADR-001 Phase 0 description (bakes Critical concerns into Phase 0)
- Updated vision.md (added GTM anti-goals)
- Created this roadmap structure

The 23 other prospective ADRs are in [backlog.md](backlog.md). They land as they become relevant — most are Phase-0-blocking and get written during Phase 0.

## Immediate next concrete step

Sub-phase **0b — axis protos**. In `contracts/proto/`:
1. Write `strategy/v1/strategy.proto` (the `Apply` RPC ⇒ `rat://strategy/v1/apply`).
2. Write `format/v1/format.proto` (scan/merge/append ⇒ `rat://format-capability/v1/*`).
3. Write `runtime/v1/runtime.proto` (`Execute` ⇒ `rat://runtime/v1/execute`).
4. These three are the ones the example manifests already reference, so they close the loop between manifest and wire contract first.
5. Before generating any SDK: add `buf.yaml` + decide the validator/codegen container image (also unblocks 0f tooling). This is where the Go/buf toolchain in `.claude/settings.json` first gets exercised.
6. As each axis proto lands, derive its per-kind manifest schema (the 0a → 0b handoff recorded in `contracts/schema/README.md`).

Also pending (deferred Claude-config item, now triggerable since the first `.proto`/code is imminent): the `PostToolUse` auto-format hook (`gofmt`/`buf format`) — see [backlog.md](backlog.md). Land it when the first proto/Go file is committed.

## What's NOT in flight (paused / cancelled)

- Phase 0 sub-phases 0c–0h — not started
- Phase 1-5 — not started
- The 23 other prospective ADRs from synthesis — backlogged (ADRs 004–013 land during Phase 0 as contracts are drafted)

## Maintenance reminder

When this stream's status changes (e.g., Tom commits and Phase 0 kicks off, or a new working session produces concrete output):

1. Update this file (`current.md`).
2. Append the completed work to [done.md](done.md).
3. Update [phases.md](phases.md) status table.
4. Promote any new identified work from inbox / reviews → [backlog.md](backlog.md).

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) in this directory for the full maintenance rules.
